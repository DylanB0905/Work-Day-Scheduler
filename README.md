# <Work-Day-Scheduler>

## Description

My motivation for this project was to create an application where i can type out the things i need to do throughout the work day.
I learned alot about using jquery and moment.js to add the time and date to the webpage and for sending and grabbing the user inputs to/from the local storage. the problem this project solved is that it helps me stay more organised and lets me concentrate on the things i need to get down.
